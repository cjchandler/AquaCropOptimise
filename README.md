AquaCrop v7.0 and higher versions are released as open-source Fortran code,
developed by KU Leuven and endorsed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
of the United Nations.
Compared to AquaCrop v6.0, the AquaCrop v7.0 and higher versions
feature bug fixes, performance improvements and internal restructuring,
a translation from Pascal to Fortran, and a range of new and/or updated
scientific features.

The following applications are publicly distributed:
* AquaCrop version-controlled open **source code** (this GitHub page, and zip-file under [Releases](
  https://github.com/KUL-RSDA/AquaCrop/releases))
* AquaCrop standard Windows **graphical user interface** (zip-file under [Releases](
  https://github.com/KUL-RSDA/AquaCrop/releases))
* AquaCrop **standalone executable** (zip-file under [Releases](
  https://github.com/KUL-RSDA/AquaCrop/releases)) for
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * MacOS

From v7.0 onwards, it is also possible to use AquaCrop
as a crop model within [NASA’s Land Information System (LIS)](
https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF). More information can be found in
the LIS section below.

## Documentation

Online documentation and contact information are available at the [FAO website](https://www.fao.org/aquacrop/en/). The AquaCrop core team is small and answers will be found fastest in the release notes, training handbooks and youtube videos provided by FAO.

Please also visit our [Discussions](https://github.com/KUL-RSDA/AquaCrop/discussions) forum for FAQ, or to contribute.

## Running the executable

Download the ZIP file with the AquaCrop executable (v7.0 or higher) for
Windows, Linux or MacOS from the release page. 
Consult the reference manual (FAO website) for details about the AquaCrop stand-alone program.

Optionally, it can be verified if the executable produces the expected output on the user's system, by running a self-contained testcase for which reference output is provided (zip-file under [Releases](
  https://github.com/KUL-RSDA/AquaCrop/releases)). Please carefully read the README file to run the testcase.

## Citation

A wide range of publications is available to refer to AquaCrop in the GUI or standalone version.
The users can refer to any publication of their choice, when using these AquaCrop assets. 

In case the open source code of AquaCrop (from v7.0 onwards) is used, please refer to one of the following papers, covering precursory work in preparation for the open source release. Publications using AquaCrop v7.0 and higher versions in NASA's LIS will be added for reference as soon as they become available.
